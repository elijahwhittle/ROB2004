# Laboratory 5 and 6: Resolved rate control

Welcome to the fifth and sixth laboratories of the semester. 

## Goals
The goals of the laboratories are
1. learn how to compute geometric Jacobians
2. implement a resolved-rate controller to perform various motions


## Pre-requisites
Most of the lab can be done on your personal computer (except the real-robot part). All the required software is installed on the lab computers but to do the lab on your machine, you will need to have installed on your machine:
* Python 3 (e.g. using Anaconda)
* numpy, matplotlib (comes by default with Anaconda)
* pybullet (using pip to install)

## Instructions
Complete the notebook
