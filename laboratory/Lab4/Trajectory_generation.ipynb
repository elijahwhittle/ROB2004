This will likely create a very jerky movement which could damage the robot, its motors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, at every control cycle, it is desirable to compute a desired position to send to the PD controller which is \"in-between\" the initial and goal position. One straightforward manner to do this is to interpolate between the initial and goal position. For example, we could set\n",
