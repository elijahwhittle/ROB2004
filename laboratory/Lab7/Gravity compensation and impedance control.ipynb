    "# 2 Impedance control\n",
    "\n",
    "Last laboratory, we used the inverse of the Jacobian to control the finger position and move it in arbitrary directions.\n",
    "We were inverting the relationship $\\dot{p}_{finger} = J \\dot{\\theta}$ to compute the desired velocity of the joint given a desired velocity of the finger.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this laboratory, we will revisit direct control of the finger, this time using the relationship $\\tau = J^T F_{finger}$, where $\\tau$ is the vector of motor torques and $F_{finger}$ the 3D force at the end-effector.\n",
    "For a desired force $F_{pos}$, we can directly compute the required motor torques $\\tau$ without the need to compute\n",
    "any inverse. We will use this relationship to move the finger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we want the finger to behave as if springs and dampers were attached to it, as shown in this figure\n",
    "![](./spring_schematics.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the $x$ direction. An ideal spring will have a stiffness $K_x$ and a rest position $x_0$. Therefore, we should see a force pushing or pulling the finger according to $F_x = K_x (x_0 - x_{measured})$, where $x_{measured}$ is the measured position of the finger (make sure that $x_0$ and $x_{measured}$ are expressed in the same coordinate frame!)\n",
    "\n",
    "In 3D, setting the rest position to $p_0 = [x_0, y_0, z_0]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, we will have a force $$F = K (p_0 - p_{measured})$$\n",
    "where where $p_{measured}$ is the measured position of the finger in 3D and $K$ is a diagonal gain matrix that contains the stiffnesses of the 3 springs one its diagonal, i.e. \n",
    "$$K = \\begin{bmatrix} K_x & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & K_y & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & K_z \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this behavior, one can simply set the torques on the motors of the robot as\n",
    "$$ \\tau = J_{Ov}^T K (p_0 - p_{measured})$$ The leg will then behave like a spring.\n",
    "Note here that we are only using the bottom three rows of the Jacobian, as we are only interested in the force and not the moments (which we ignore).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to a spring, it is often a good idea to have a damper, that will dampen out any oscillations of the spring such that the leg can reach its rest position $p_0$ (otherwise it would oscillate forever). We can then also add a force conteracting velocity of the finger as\n",
    "$-D \\dot{p}_{measured}$, where $D$ is a diagonal matrix that contains the damping gains for each spring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting controller is then\n",
    "$$\\tau = J_{Ov}^T \\Big( K (p_0 - p_{measured}) - D \\dot{p}_{measured} \\Big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If one wants to track desired setpoint positions (e.g. a trajectory of setpoints) and maybe also a desired velocity,\n",
    "we can easily adapt the impedance controller as follows\n",
    "$$\\tau = J_{Ov}^T \\Big( K (p_{ref}(t) - p_{measured}) + D (\\dot{p}_{ref}(t) - \\dot{p}_{measured}) \\Big)$$\n",
    "where $p_{ref}(t)$ is a reference trajectory of set points. Note here how this resembles a PD controller in the end-effector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "1. Write an impedance controller with a constant stiffness $K_x = K_z = 50$ and $K_y = 10$ and with damping only in the x,z direction ($D_x = D_z = 5$, $D_y = 0$) so the vertical direction will behave like a ideal spring.\n",
    "Set $p_0 = [0.3, -0.2, 0.014]$. Add gravity compensation to the controller as well. Plot the position of the end-effector and its velocity as a function of time. Does it behave as expected? (make sure you start the robot with initial configuration $q=[0,0,0]$).\n",
    "2. Redo the same experiment when adding damping in the y direction $D_y = .1$ and then again with $D_y = 1$. Plot again the end-effector positions and velocities, what do you notice different? (make sure you start the robot with initial configuration $q=[0,0,0]$).\n",
    "3. Write an impedance controller that can draw a circle in the x-y plane. We would like to follow the 3D finger trajectory $$x_{ref}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.3 + 0.05\\cos(\\omega t) \\\\ -0.2 + 0.05 \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "where $\\omega = \\pi$ is the frequency of rotation around the circle (frequency of rotation of $0.5Hz$).\n",
    "Use $K = \\text{Diag}([50,50,50])$ and $D = \\text{Diag}([5,5,5])$. Plot the desired and measured positions of the finger as well as the desired and measured velocities of the finger. Compare your results with what you did in Lab5. What are the pros and cons of both methods?\n",
    "4. Test the controller(s) on the real robot and perform the same analysis."
