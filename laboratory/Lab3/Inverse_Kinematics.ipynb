    "# Analytic Inverse Kinematics of the NYU finger in the plane\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the last laboratories, it is not obvious to get the tip of the finger to follow a given movement, such as a circle. We know the forward kinematics of the robot, which gives us the position of the fingertip given joint angles. Today we will work out the inverse function, to get joint angles given fingertip positions: this is called inverse kinematics. To keep the problem manageable, we will work with the robot in \"2D\" and keep the first joint at a constant 0 position.\n",
