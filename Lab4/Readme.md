# Laboratory 4: Trajectory generation

Welcome to the fourth laboratory of the semester. 

## Goals
The goals of the laboratory are
1. learn how to generate trajectories with desirable properties
2. implement a reaching controller with these trajectories


## Pre-requisites
Most of the lab can be done on your personal computer (except the real-robot part). All the required software is installed on the lab computers but to do the lab on your machine, you will need to have installed on your machine:
* Python 3 (e.g. using Anaconda)
* numpy, matplotlib (comes by default with Anaconda)
* pybullet (using pip to install)

## Instructions
Complete the [Inverse Kinematics notebook](Inverse_Kinematics.ipynb)
