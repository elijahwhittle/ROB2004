# Laboratory 3: Analytic Inverse Kinematics

Welcome to the third laboratory of the semester. 

## Goals
The goals of the laboratory are
1. learn how to compute analytic inverse kinematic solutions for simple kinematic chains
2. implement your first inverse kinematics algorithm
3. implement a simple reaching controller


## Pre-requisites
Most of the lab can be done on your personal computer (except the real-robot part). All the required software is installed on the lab computers but to do the lab on your machine, you will need to have installed on your machine:
* Python 3 (e.g. using Anaconda)
* numpy, matplotlib (comes by default with Anaconda)
* pybullet (using pip to install)

## Instructions
Complete the [Inverse Kinematics notebook](Inverse_Kinematics.ipynb)
