    "* [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio), a rigid body dynamics library (which does all the kinematics computation for us). You can install it directly through conda `conda install pinocchio -c conda-forge` or follow the [installation instructions](https://stack-of-tasks.github.io/pinocchio/download.html#Install_3)\n",
    "* [Meshcat](https://github.com/rdeits/meshcat-python) which is used for the visualization of the robot. You can install it directly through pip `pip install meshcat`"
